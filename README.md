tech-tips
=========

tech-tips is a set of miscellaneous tech tips that are useful for engineers at Mustard Grain. It started off as a set of Confluence wiki pages, but we realized that we spent more time fighting with Confluence for simple formatting than editing content. In addition, these pages are now globally available should someone else stumble upon them. And, it's free! :)
