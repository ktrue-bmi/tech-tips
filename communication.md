## Email Crafting Tips
### Write a meaningful subject line
  Write a subject line that describes the content of the message, keeping it succinct and descriptive, but not overly wordy.
  For example:

```
Use:
  Subject: BEAC-7155 - Need information to fix leak column
  
Not:
  Subject: Blank
  Subject: BEAC-7155
  Subject: BEAC-7155 - Already finished fixing the battery level column, but I need some help fixing the leak column
  Subject: Fix leak
```

  Your reader should be able to tell the gist of the message you want to convey in the email, but the subject shouldn't contain most of the email by itself.

### Avoid attachements when possible
  If you want to share information from a document with the person you're emailing, if they don't need to read through the whole thing, instead of attaching the whole document try to quote the applicable portions from the email for the person that you're emailing.
  
### Proofread
  If you're emailing someone where spelling and how you put the content really matters then send a draft to a colleague to proofread your message.
