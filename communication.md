## Email Crafting Tips
### Write a meaningful subject line
  Write a subject line that describes the content of the message, keeping it succinct and descriptive, but not overly wordy.
  For example:

```
Use:
  Subject: BEAC-7155 - Need information to fix leak column
  
Not:
  Subject: Blank
  Subject: BEAC-7155
  Subject: BEAC-7155 - Already finished fixing the battery level column, but I need some help fixing the leak column
  Subject: Fix leak
```

  Your reader should be able to tell the gist of the message you want to convey in the email, but the subject shouldn't contain most of the email by itself.
