## General Communication
### Listen properly
  When someone is speaking with you about a problem, don't lose focus on the issue that is being brought up. When working with a large code base it can be very easy when another developer is trying discussing an issue, to start to think of something tangental. Try to focus on listening to the issue at hand, as well as what your response is. If you need to then you can ask for a moment and write down your thoughts on what has been said, and go back to focusing on the discussion.

### Don't be afraid of disagreeing
  Even if it's in your nature to regularly avoid disagreements, try not to avoid it all the time when discussing code. At times it can be very productive to express negative feedback when reviewing code, or disagreeing with a certain way something is written or expressed. Of course try to express yourself in a kind way, even when you disagree with something, however, if we never expressed our opinion when we disagreed with how something was written or put, we would also likely allow bugs or other issues to enter into our code.

### Mind your written tone
  It can be easy for us to forget at times that it can be difficult to decipher tone through written messages. Try to keep in mind that we won't always know the state of mind of the person we are trying to communicate with. We may want to try to write words to soften our tone or even emoticons to ensure that what we say isn't taken harshly, when being harsh is not our intention.

## Email Crafting Tips
### Write a meaningful subject line
  Write a subject line that describes the content of the message, keeping it succinct and descriptive, but not overly wordy.
  For example:

```
Use:
  Subject: BEAC-7155 - Need information to fix leak column
  
Not:
  Subject: Blank
  Subject: BEAC-7155
  Subject: BEAC-7155 - Already finished fixing the battery level column, but I need some help fixing the leak column
  Subject: Fix leak
```

  Your reader should be able to tell the gist of the message you want to convey in the email, but the subject shouldn't contain most of the email by itself.

### Avoid attachements when possible
  If you want to share information from a document with the person you're emailing, if they don't need to read through the whole thing, instead of attaching the whole document try to quote the applicable portions from the email for the person that you're emailing.
  
### Proofread
  If you're emailing someone where spelling and how you put the content really matters then send a draft to a colleague to proofread your message.
