### Follow a consistant style
  Remain consistant with how code is in the code base. For instance remain consistant with your whitespace, naming, commenting and whatever other rules have been established.

### Get someone to code review your work
  Find a fellow developer to help you review code together to correct potential mistakes and long-term issues that you may not have thought of

### Refactor regularly
  When writing code at the first pass if you feel that the piece you wrote could be written better, don't just ignore it, consider making a note to refactor.
